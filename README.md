Check out my sorting algorithm visualizer at https://obriensortingvisualizer.web.app/

This past summer, I dedicated much of my free time to learning the fundamentals of frontend web development. I have always been interested in algorithmic efficiency-type questions and wanted to connect that knowledge with the new skills and technologies I just learned. This visualizer was created with ReactJS, HTML and CSS.
